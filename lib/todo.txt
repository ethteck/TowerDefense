REFACTORING / FORMATTING:
clean onMouseMove
better collision detection
	
ADD FEATURE:
	the m_ schnip on everything	
	work on available spaces vector of vectors of points
	
	Create EnemyManager class to
		keep track of enemies and hold the enemies vector
		keep track of total spawned enemies
		spawn enemies based on frames, allowing for multiple waves
	instance names need to change (all towers shouldn't be called "mcTower")
	SEMI HOMING THINGS!
	towers of varying sizes (let's start with a 3x2)
	target based on enemy level (once enemy level exists)
	enemies that can
		go "invisible" to towers (aren't added to targets list)
		go indestructible momentarily (hit but to no avail)
		ignore all bullets momentarily (pass through)
	placeholder pause graphics
	implement better collision detection for VERY fast bullets (time based, using formulae and schnip)
	maybe have towers pass bullet stats (speed, power, crit stuff) to the bullet
	
	if there are multiple of the same best target results, filter further

BUG:

LOOK AT LATER:
	tower A's range thing overlays in front of tower B if both A and B are selected and A is selected after B
	depth bullshit
